# Trip Reel Project

A mobile movie app that features dynamically updated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. This app was built from scratch collaboratively with a team of six coders, which allowed us to learn agile development methodologies and implement feature and bug fixes using the git branch workflow and pull requests.
